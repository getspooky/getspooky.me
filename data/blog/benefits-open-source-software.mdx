## Overview

Open-source software (OSS) dictates that the source code of an open-source project is publicly accessible, and may be redistributed and modified by a community of developers.

The term "open source" was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position. In addition, the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.

The majority of OSS is distributed freely like [linux](https://www.linux.org/), [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) etc, making it very cost-effective. Unlike closed proprietary software, OSS can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code.

## Reasons to choose Open Source

We list you some of the reasons why we think you should be using Open Source solutions :

#### 1. Cost

The majority of OSS is distributed freely, making it very cost-effective. Unlike closed proprietary software, OSS can be altered and extended by any developer familiar with the source code.

### 2. Support

OSS offers long-term viability because hundreds of developers supporting a widely adopted OSS project can be called upon long into the future.

### 3. Flexibility

You have the possibility of using whatever version or build of the software and of the hardware you need. You upgrade whenever you feel like it.

### 4. Auditability

Open Source code is visible to everyone. Everyone. If you feel like you want to know for sure whether or not your software is secure and adhering to certain standards, then Open Source Software is exactly what you need

## How society benefits from Open Source

In addition to the practical benefits that Open Source offers to individuals and technology, its philosophy has some political advantages. Transparency and equitable distribution of public assets are two examples of how Open Source can help society. This might be accomplished by implementing Open Source software across all government platforms. A democratic society should demand public code in every public system so that people know how their data is used/processed.
