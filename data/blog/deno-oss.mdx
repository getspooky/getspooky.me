## Overview

Before reading this document, please check out the official [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://deno.land/manual@v1.12.2/contributing) by Deno team. This document aims to be a complement to the above guidelines and if you are new to **Deno** make sure to read [First look at Deno](/blog/first-look-at-deno).

Deno std (Standard library) a set of standard modules (`http`, `fmt`, `fs` ...) that are audited by the core team and are guaranteed to work with Deno. Std is written entirely in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) so it's necessary to have some basic knowledge of `Typescript` or `JavaScript`.

## Code of Conduct

The Contributor Covenant has been adopted by Deno as its [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read the entire paragraph to understand what activities will be permitted and which will not.

## Open Development

All Deno development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Pull requests are sent by both core team members and external contributors, and they all go through the same review procedure.

## Bugs

Deno uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/issues) for public bugs. They keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesnâ€™t already exist.

## Got a Question or Problem?

**Do not open issues for general support questions**. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) where the questions should be tagged with tag [deno](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/deno).

Stack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:

- Questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else
- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via deno [discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/deno).

## Your First Pull Request

Before **submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

- Search [GitHub]() for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
