### <samp>Hey, there! 👋 </samp>

<samp>I'm a Software Engineer from Morocco 🇲🇦 highly motivated, dynamic, persevering, rigorous. I was born in 1999 (you can do the math) and grew up in Idaho. I am passionate about Web Development, blockchain and open source. 🤗 I’m looking forward to collaborate on any Open Source project which I consider interesting and useful. I'm also a `Speciality Tea drinking geek` 🍵.</samp>
